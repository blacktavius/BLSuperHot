# Mod Description
 This mod aims to make borderlands play like SuperHot. The mod is meant to be played with a keyboard and mouse because it takes keyboard input to slow/speed up time, so controllers wont work. The V1.0 also assumes you have not remapped movement, shooting, grenade or interact keys. The Zip contains two versions. The first is Oneshot which increases enemy damage and lowers their health so you die in one or two shots (depending on healthgate) and enemies die in one. The second mode leaves all scaling the same in the game and just adds the Super Hot mechanics. (1-Shot Works for BL2 not for BLTPS)

#     Bugs
      1. In OneShot Mode lighting Varkids on fire is not possible due to their low health. 
         Blooding also is invincible in OneShot mode. To fix these turn the game back on to normal scaling.
      2. Bug with Scoping where scope is held up to face but does not scope in. Happens rarely, dunno man. 
# FAQ 
        Q: Boot order?
        A: For normal Scaling it doesn't matter. For OneShot mode the game must be started and on title screen before the 
           mod is run. 

        Q: Game won't change scaling when I run one shot in game. Why do?
        A: Scaling changes have to be done on the title screen. 

        Q: Game moves normally when I hold E or F. Am I hacking?
        A: This is so interactions with things such as opening a menu or picking up Items work in real time.
 
        Q: Black! These two boxes popped up when I clicked the .bat file! Am I being hacked?
        A: The boxes are console applications so you will always have then when you are running the program. To 
           stop execution close the boxes.
 
        Q: I closed the boxes and now everything is slow forever?
        A: Open your console with ` and write:  set WorldInfo TimeDilation 1.00
        
        Q: One Shot for BLTPS doesn't work?
        A: Yup! The mod wasn't intended for TPS to begin with so the scaling needs some work. Normal mode does work though.
